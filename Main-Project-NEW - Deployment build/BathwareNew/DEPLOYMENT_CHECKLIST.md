## ‚úÖ Deployment Complete!

When everything is checked off:

- [ ] Frontend is live and accessible
- [ ] Backend is live and responding
- [ ] Database is populated and working
- [ ] All features tested and working
- [ ] URLs documented and saved
- [ ] Access credentials secured

**üéâ Congratulations! Your Bathware System is deployed! üéâ**

## üìä Post-Deployment

### Things to Monitor:

- [ ] Service uptime (Render dashboard)
- [ ] Build minutes usage (free tier limits)
- [ ] Database size (free tier: 1GB)
- [ ] Bandwidth usage (Netlify: 100GB/month)
- [ ] Error rates (check logs regularly)

### Maintenance Schedule:

- **Daily:** Check if services are running
- **Weekly:** Review logs for errors
- **Monthly:** Check usage limits, update dependencies
- **As needed:** Apply security updates, add features

### Upgrade Considerations:

If you outgrow free tier:
- Render backend: $7/month (no sleep)
- Render database: $7/month (more storage)
- Netlify stays free (excellent free tier)
